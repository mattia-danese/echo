Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms of Service. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice ("Notice").<br/>
              Any Notice to echo should be sent by mail to: 300 Delaware Ave, Ste 210 #721, Wilmington, DE 19801.Any Notice sent to You will be sent to the address on file for Your account.

              If the parties not able to resolve the dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules for that forum, except You and echo will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA's Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount. Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms of Service (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.

If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.
